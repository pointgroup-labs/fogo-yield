 * Connections, and so the inevitable second target (e.g. a return path)
 * doesn't tempt anyone to copy-paste the entire pipeline.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a registry / dispatch table — codex flagged that as
 * over-engineering for a registry-of-one. A second target adds a second
 * call site, not a second abstraction layer.
