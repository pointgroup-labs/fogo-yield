/**
 * Single registry for every RPC `Connection` and the read-only
 * `RelayerClient` the webapp uses. Connections are keyed by URL via a
 * `Map`, so swapping endpoints in the settings drawer transparently
 * returns a fresh instance on the next call without disturbing any other
 * URL's cached connection.
 *
 * Cache eviction is intentionally absent — in normal use a session sees
 * at most a handful of distinct URLs (default + the user's preferred
 * override), so the Map can't meaningfully grow. The `RpcSelect`
 * component debounces custom-URL input commits so mid-typing values
 * don't pollute the cache.
 *
 * The webapp never *signs* on Solana — every Solana-side instruction is
 * permissionless and cranked off-chain — so a throwaway keypair plus a
 * sign-throws stub is a safe stand-in for AnchorProvider's wallet
 * contract. `Wallet` is exported from `@anchor-lang/core`'s CJS build
 * but not its ESM build, so we inline the minimal interface here.
