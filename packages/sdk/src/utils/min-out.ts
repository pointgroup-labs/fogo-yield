/**
 * Client-side swap-floor (`min_out`) computation — the value the user signs;

 * (`out_received >= flow.min_swap_out`). The NAV math below is just to pick a
 * sensible floor, not an on-chain enforcement mirror:
 *   - it is computed against the NTT POST-TRIM input (spec §10/G2), so the
 *     caller passes `postTrimInAmount` (use `applyNttTrim`), not the raw UI
 *     amount;
 *   - deposit floors the GROSS OnRe output (the relayer skims the deposit fee
 *     after the swap), so the deposit fee is NOT subtracted here;
 *   - withdraw floors USDC out for the NET ONyc input (the relayer takes the
 *     withdraw fee from the input before the swap), so the fee is subtracted.
 *
 * The slippage haircut covers venue execution (OnRe `take_offer` fee /
 * Jupiter) + market drift; too tight just reverts on-chain (fail-safe).
