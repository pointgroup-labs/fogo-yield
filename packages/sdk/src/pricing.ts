 * **Convention.** `basePrice` and `priceScale` together represent the
 * **base-unit ratio** of USDC to ONyc, scaled as fixed-point:
 *
 *   real_ratio = basePrice / priceScale     (USDC base units per ONyc base unit)
 *
 * USDC is 6 decimals and ONyc is 9 decimals, so the human price 1.00 USDC
 * per 1 ONyc corresponds to a base-unit ratio of `1e6 / 1e9 = 0.001`.
 * Concretely, with `priceScale = 1_000_000_000n`, that human price is
 * stored as `basePrice = 1_000_000n`.
 *
 * Use `humanPriceToBaseRatio` at the boundary (UI inputs, config files,
 * test fixtures) to convert between human prices and this representation.
 * The quote functions below stay decimal-agnostic and operate purely on
 * base-unit amounts and base-unit ratios.
 *
 * Picking `priceScale = 1_000_000_000n` gives 9 digits of resolution which
 * is comfortably more than enough for ONyc's APR over realistic intervals.
