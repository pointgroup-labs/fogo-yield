# Security Model

This document captures the trust boundaries of the fogo-onre relayer
program: which keys exist, what each can do, and what happens if each is
compromised.

The relayer's headline property — **"the relayer has no privileged caller"** —
means every flow-driving instruction (`claim_usdc`, `swap_usdc_to_onyc`,
`lock_onyc`, `unlock_onyc`, `swap_onyc_to_usdc`, `send_usdc_to_user`) is
**permissionless**: any wallet on the network can submit them. Safety does
not depend on who pays the transaction fee. This is the result of several
layered design choices documented here. None of the layers individually
is sufficient; the model assumes all are in place.

> **⚠️ April 2026 correction — withdraw chain (`unlock_onyc` →
> `swap_onyc_to_usdc` → `send_usdc_to_user`)**: the "every operational
> instruction is permissionless" property has been **verified false** for
> the withdraw leg against the live OnRe protocol
> (`onre-finance/onre-sol`). `swap_onyc_to_usdc` CPIs OnRe
> `take_offer_permissionless` against an `Offer` PDA, but OnRe models
> withdrawals as a separate `RedemptionOffer` account type with a
> two-step async flow (`create_redemption_request` →
> `fulfill_redemption_request`, the latter gated on `boss ||
> redemption_admin`). The relayer-side withdraw chain therefore
> **cannot complete on mainnet today**, and even after a redesign the
> fulfill leg will inherit a soft dependency on OnRe's
> `redemption_admin` — i.e. the system will no longer be fully
> permissionless on the withdraw side. This invalidates several
> claims further down (§3 OnRe trust row, §6 stuck-flow runbook
> assumptions about re-cranking permissionlessly through the swap).
> See `docs/PRE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` §4 for the deploy gate. The
> deposit chain is unaffected.

## 1. Key inventory

| Key                             | Holder                            | Lifecycle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | On-chain capability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

There is **no operator / curator / cranker key** in the relayer's trust
model. Anyone with enough SOL to pay the transaction fee can submit any
flow-driving instruction. This is intentional: making cranking
permissionless eliminates an entire class of "what if the operator is
malicious / unavailable / compromised" failure modes.

The relayer program itself owns **no keys** — every long-lived authority
on its accounts is a PDA derived from the program ID + a fixed seed.
There is no "admin" with elevated access to relayer state.

## 2. PDA inventory

Every account the relayer authorities over is a PDA. The seeds are
defined in `programs/relayer/src/constants.rs` and mirrored in the SDK.

| PDA                   | Seeds                                                                                               | Owner / signer  | Purpose                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relayer authority     | `[b"relayer"]`                                                                                      | Relayer program | Owns the long-lived USDC and ONyc ATAs; signs every outbound CPI.                               |
| Redeemer              | `[b"redeemer"]`                                                                                     | Relayer program | Per-claim signer for TB `CompleteWrappedWithPayload`; owns the short-lived intake USDC ATA.     |
| Config                | `[b"relayer_config"]`                                                                               | Relayer program | Stores `usdc_mint`, `onyc_mint`, fee BPS, fee vault. Settable only by the configured authority. |
| Inbound Flow          | `[b"inflight", gateway_claim_pubkey]`                                                               | Relayer program | Receipt for an in-progress deposit. Init-once on `claim_usdc`.                                  |
| Outbound Flow         | `[b"outflight", ntt_inbox_pubkey]`                                                                  | Relayer program | Receipt for an in-progress withdrawal. Init-once on `unlock_onyc`.                              |
| NTT session authority | `[b"session_authority", sender, keccak(transfer_args)]` (under `NTT_PROGRAM_ID`, not the relayer's) | NTT program     | Per-call delegate for `transfer_lock`.                                                          |

**Key property**: every Flow PDA is seeded by the _bridge's own
per-message claim/inbox PDA_, which is itself created via CPI by the
bridge program. A caller cannot forge a Flow seed without first having
the bridge accept a guardian-signed VAA — i.e., replay protection is
inherited from Wormhole.

## 3. Trust boundaries

### Wormhole guardians (19-of-19 threshold for governance, 13-of-19 for messages)

Trusted to honestly attest source-chain events. Compromise of ≥13 guardian
keys would let an attacker forge a `claim_usdc` VAA and direct minted USDC

- associated bONyc to an attacker-controlled FOGO address. Outside the
  relayer's control; mitigated by Wormhole's own operational security.

### Wormhole Token Bridge / Gateway program

Trusted to correctly mint wrapped USDC, manage the wrapped-mint authority,
and enforce the redeemer-PDA pattern. The relayer hardcodes the program
ID (`wormDTUJ6AWPNvk59vGQbDvGJmqbDTdgWgAqcLBCgUb`) and the instruction
discriminator as `pub const` values in `programs/relayer/src/constants.rs`.
A future PR swapping these would compile and pass CI silently — code
review of `constants.rs` diffs is the only defense (see §7).

### NTT manager program

Trusted to correctly lock ONyc into custody on outbound and release on
inbound. Same pinning treatment as Gateway. Relayer also encodes the
positional `redeem_accounts_len` split that NTT expects — see
`InvalidAccountSplit` in `claim_usdc.rs`.

### OnRe program

Trusted to honor `take_offer_permissionless` semantics: USDC in → ONyc
out at the published price, plus apply OnRe's own fee. The relayer does
not validate the OnRe price calculation; it trusts whatever ONyc amount
`take_offer_permissionless` deposits to the relayer's authority-owned
ATA, then applies the deposit fee on the post-swap output.

> **⚠️ Asymmetric — applies to deposit only.** The withdraw direction
> (ONyc → USDC) does NOT have a `take_offer_permissionless`
> counterpart in OnRe. Withdrawals route through `RedemptionOffer`
> (`create_redemption_request` → `fulfill_redemption_request`,
> fulfill gated on `boss || redemption_admin`). The relayer's
> `swap_onyc_to_usdc` is therefore mis-targeted today and the trust
> assumption above does NOT cover the withdraw leg. See the banner
> at the top of this document and `PRE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` §4.

### OnRe price-vector authority

A malicious or buggy price update could mint fewer wONyc shares than
deposits warrant (or more). Outside the relayer's control; mitigated by
OnRe's governance + the OnRe vault's defensive caps on per-block NAV
movement.

## 4. Attack surface — what each compromised key can do

### 4.1 Compromised upgrade authority

**Blast radius: TOTAL.** The attacker can ship a new relayer `.so` that
ignores every safety check below. They can drain the relayer's
authority-owned USDC and ONyc ATAs, redirect outbound transfers to any
address, and forge Flow PDAs to defraud the FOGO-side vault.

**Mitigations:**

- Set upgrade authority to `None` (immutable) at deploy, OR transfer to
  a hardware-backed multisig with public threshold.
- Never leave on a single hot key. See `PRE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` §2.

### 4.2 Malicious / arbitrary caller of a flow instruction

**Blast radius: ~ZERO.** The flow instructions are permissionless — any
wallet can submit them, and that's by design. Every safety-critical input
(`fogo_sender`, `gateway_claim`, `ntt_inbox_item`, the in-flight token
amount) is parsed from a guardian-signed VAA or a CPI-created bridge PDA,
not from a caller-supplied parameter. The caller cannot:

- Choose the outbound recipient — `lock_onyc` and `send_usdc_to_user`
  read `flow.fogo_sender` (parsed from the VAA on `claim_usdc` /
  `unlock_onyc`), not a parameter.
- Forge a Flow PDA — Flow seeds include the bridge's CPI-created
  claim/inbox PDA; nobody can create that without first feeding a real
  guardian-signed VAA through the bridge.
- Skip or reorder the steps — `swap_usdc_to_onyc` requires `flow.status
  == Claimed` and transitions to `Swapped`; `lock_onyc` requires
  `Swapped`. Each handler emits an `emit!` event so misordered attempts
  are visible on-chain.
- Drain the long-lived USDC / ONyc ATAs — the relayer authority PDA
  signs all CPIs; an external wallet has no signing power over PDAs.
- Pocket the fee — fees are routed to the configured `fee_vault` (set
  by the config authority at `initialize` / `configure` time), not to
  the caller.

**Worst case from a malicious caller:**

- Submit junk transactions that fail and burn their own SOL.
- Race a legitimate caller to crank a flow (no harm — outcome is the
  same; the loser pays a failed-tx fee).
- Reclaim rent from a Flow PDA they themselves paid for after the flow
  completes (this is the normal close path; rent is returned to
  whichever wallet originally paid for the PDA).

A caller paying for a Flow PDA on someone else's deposit cannot
withhold rent reclamation maliciously — `lock_onyc` / `send_usdc_to_user`
close the PDA atomically with the final CPI, returning rent to the
original payer. The original payer's wallet is recorded in the Flow PDA
at init time.

This is the system's headline property. It depends on §4.1 holding —
if the attacker has the upgrade authority, none of this matters.

### 4.2.5 Compromised config authority

**Blast radius: NEAR-TOTAL on operating balances.** The config authority
is set at `initialize` and rotatable only via `configure`. There is no
separate rotation instruction. A compromised config authority can:

- **Drain operating ATAs via `sweep`.** `sweep.rs` exposes an
  authority-only escape hatch that signs `transfer_checked` with the
  relayer authority PDA. The attacker can move arbitrary amounts of
  USDC and ONyc out of the long-lived authority-owned ATAs to any
  destination of their choosing. This includes any in-flight balances
  that have landed in those ATAs between flow stages (e.g. USDC that
  has been claimed but not yet swapped, ONyc that has been swapped but
  not yet locked).
- **Set fees to 100%.** `configure` bounds `deposit_fee_bps` /
  `withdraw_fee_bps` at 10000 (`FeeBpsTooHigh`) but allows exactly
  that. Combined with a redirected `fee_vault`, every future flow
  effectively pays the entire amount to the attacker.
- **Redirect `fee_vault` to an attacker-controlled account.** The fee
  vault is an account address stored in config; there is no on-chain
  identity check on it. Setting it to any ATA the attacker controls
  funnels all future fees to them.

**What the config authority CANNOT do:**

- Redirect a specific flow's outbound recipient. `lock_onyc` and
  `send_usdc_to_user` read `flow.fogo_sender` (parsed from the VAA at
  `claim_usdc` / `unlock_onyc` time), not from config. An in-flight
  flow that has already passed the swap stage will still try to deliver
  to the original VAA-bound recipient — but `sweep` can drain the
  source ATA before the delivery CPI runs, leaving the deliver step to
  fail.
- Forge a Flow PDA or skip status guards. Those are enforced by the
  program logic, not by config.
- Replace the program. That requires the upgrade authority (§4.1).

**Rotation:** Two-step propose/accept, designed for multisig → multisig
handoff where the two parties cannot easily co-sign one transaction.

1. **Propose** — current authority calls
   `configure(new_authority=Some(pk))`. This writes `pk` to
   `config.pending_authority`; `config.authority` is unchanged.
   Re-proposing overwrites the prior pending value.
   `Some(Pubkey::default())` cancels any in-flight proposal
   (clears `pending_authority` to `None`).
2. **Accept** — the proposed key signs `accept_authority` in a
   separate transaction. The handler verifies the signer equals
   `pending_authority`, then atomically copies pending into
   `authority` and clears the pending slot. The current authority
   does not participate.

This design **eliminates the typo-brick class**: a typo in step 1
just sits in the pending slot until either the current authority
overwrites/cancels it, or somebody who happens to control the typoed
key signs `accept_authority`. Until step 2 succeeds, the current
authority retains full control.

A compromised config authority can still rotate to an attacker-controlled
key by proposing the attacker's key and waiting for the attacker to
accept. This both **locks the legitimate operator out** and survives
any subsequent revocation of the original compromised key. This does
not expand the _fund-loss_ blast radius (`sweep` already lets them
exfiltrate immediately) but it does extend the _operator-lockout_
radius indefinitely, since the only recovery is an upgrade-authority
redeploy.

**Mitigations:**

- Set the config authority to a hardware-backed multisig at
  `initialize` time. The same multisig that holds the upgrade
  authority is the natural choice — there is no operational reason to
  separate them, and using the same one avoids the "compromise either
  one is total" footgun.
- Never leave on a single hot key. The blast radius (drain operating
  ATAs + redirect all future fees + rotate authority away from the
  operator) is near-total for funds that pass through the relayer,
  even though it cannot replace the program.
- For a planned rotation: after step 1, **fetch on-chain config and
  verify `pending_authority` matches the intended successor** before
  the successor signs `accept_authority`. The two-step design lets you
  catch a misproposal before it commits.

The trust comment in `sweep.rs` notes that granting `sweep` is "no
expansion of trust" beyond fee-redirect, since both can grief users.
That framing is technically correct for _the authority itself_ but
understates blast radius for an _external attacker who steals the
key_ — `sweep` lets them exfiltrate balances immediately, while
fee-redirect only captures _future_ flows.

### 4.3 Compromised OnRe price-vector authority

**Blast radius: NAV manipulation.** The attacker can update the ONyc
price to mint inflated wONyc shares to depositors (or deflated ones,
gating withdrawals).

**Mitigations:** outside this repo. Belongs to OnRe + the OnRe vault
program's defensive NAV caps. Documented here so the on-call knows the
key exists.

### 4.4 Compromised NTT manager admin

**Blast radius: rate-limit changes.** The admin can raise or lower NTT
rate limits, which throttles legitimate flows but cannot redirect them.
A malicious admin could DoS the relayer by setting limits to zero.

**Mitigations:** outside this repo (Wormhole + OnRe operational
security). The relayer fails closed when NTT rejects a transfer for
rate-limit reasons.

### 4.5 Compromised Wormhole guardians (≥13-of-19)

**Blast radius: cross-chain inbound flows can be forged.** The attacker
can craft a VAA that the bridge will accept; the relayer will then
mint+lock+credit a FOGO recipient of the attacker's choosing. The
relayer cannot defend against this — it inherits the trust of the
underlying bridge.

**Mitigations:** Wormhole's own guardian-set governance. The fogo-onre
vault may layer additional defenses (e.g., per-block deposit caps).

## 5. Replay protection

Two independent layers:

1. **Bridge-side**: Wormhole Token Bridge creates a `gateway_claim` PDA
   on `CompleteWrappedWithPayload`; NTT creates an `inbox_item` PDA on
   `redeem`. Both are init-once and serve as the bridge's own replay
   protection.
2. **Relayer-side**: every Flow PDA is `init` (not `init_if_needed`)
   with seeds bound to the bridge PDA from layer 1. A second
   `claim_usdc` for the same VAA fails with the system program's
   `already in use` error before any CPI runs. This is asserted by
   `claim_usdc rejects replay when inflight Flow PDA already exists`
   in `tests/relayer.test.ts`.

A bug in either layer alone would not enable replay. Both must fail
simultaneously.

## 6. Fee-math safety

`apply_fee_bps` (`programs/relayer/src/state.rs`) widens to `u128`
before multiplication and uses `checked_mul` / `checked_sub` throughout.
The fee BPS is bounded at config time by `FeeBpsTooHigh` (max 10000 =
100%). Net amount is required `> 0` after fee application — zero-amount
flows are explicitly rejected.

A future change that swaps `checked_mul` for `*` or removes the u128
widening would silently allow overflow. There is no test that asserts
on the panic-free property; reviewers must catch this in PR review.

## 7. CPI allowlist (compile-time pinning only)

The relayer's CPI destinations are hardcoded `pub const Pubkey` values
in `programs/relayer/src/constants.rs`. This gives:

- **Compile-time pinning** — the program ID is baked into the `.so`,
  not loaded from an account. No way to redirect at runtime.

That is the _only_ defense. There is no automated CI alarm on changes
to these constants. A malicious PR that swaps a CPI destination would
compile, pass clippy, pass every other test, and ship — protection
relies entirely on a human reviewer noticing the diff in `constants.rs`.

**Reviewer responsibilities for any PR touching `constants.rs`:**

- Diff every changed `pub const Pubkey` against the canonical mainnet
  source (Wormhole / OnRe / NTT docs linked in each const's doc
  comment).
- Diff every changed instruction tag / sighash against the upstream
  program's IDL or source.
- A typo in the constants is indistinguishable from sabotage at this
  layer — when in doubt, block the PR and ask the author for the
  canonical source URL.

The on-chain program re-validates account _owners_ and _addresses_ via
Anchor constraints, so SDK-side drift cannot land funds at a wrong
destination — but if the on-chain `pub const` itself is swapped, the
program would happily CPI into the wrong place. There is no further
runtime check.

## 8. What this model does NOT cover

- **The FOGO-side OnRe vault program.** Its security model is documented
  separately. The relayer assumes the vault correctly accounts for
  reserve + bONyc backing and computes NAV defensively.
- **The bridge programs themselves.** Wormhole Gateway, NTT, and OnRe
  are external dependencies; the relayer trusts their published
  semantics.
- **Off-chain monitoring.** Whoever chooses to crank flows is responsible
  for their own infrastructure (alerting on stuck flows, retry logic).
  No on-chain role exists for them.
- **Economic attacks.** MEV ordering between `claim_usdc` and the
  swap, oracle manipulation of the OnRe price vector, etc., are out
  of scope.
