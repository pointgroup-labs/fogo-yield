//! Replaces the back half of the deleted `swap_onyc_to_usdc`. Pre:
//! `flow.status == RedemptionPending`, OnRe's `redemption_admin` has
//! fulfilled our `RedemptionRequest` (signal: PDA closed). Post:
//! `flow.status == Swapped`, `flow.amount = USDC delta`, singleton tracker
//! closed and rent returned to whoever paid for the request.
//!
//! No CPI is issued here — this is a pure on-chain bookkeeping update on
//! evidence of OnRe's off-chain action. After this, `send_usdc_to_user`
//! works unchanged.
