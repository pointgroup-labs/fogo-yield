/// All operational instructions are permissionless — anyone can crank any
/// step. Safety comes from the Flow PDA design: each inbound Wormhole
/// message (Gateway VAA or NTT VAA) carries the originating FOGO user's
/// wallet in its payload. `claim_usdc` / `unlock_onyc` persist that wallet
/// in a one-shot `Flow` PDA keyed by the bridge's per-VAA claim account
/// pubkey; `lock_onyc` / `send_usdc_to_user` then consume that PDA to
/// choose the outbound recipient. The Flow PDA also tracks status and
/// amount, isolating concurrent flows and enabling resumability.
